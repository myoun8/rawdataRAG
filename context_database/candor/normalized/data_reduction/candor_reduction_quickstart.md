# Reflectometry Software

This NIST NCNR page collects software and web tools for neutron and X-ray reflectometry data fitting, uncertainty analysis, raw-data reduction, scattering length density calculations, and quick reflectivity simulations. CANDOR users should use the Reductus-based reduction workflow described below as the standard path for reducing raw CANDOR reflectometry data to R vs. Q curves.

## Refl1D

Refl1D is used for fitting and uncertainty analysis of neutron and X-ray reflectivity data.

### Windows installation

Use the application installer from the most recent Refl1D release:

- Download the `...Windows-x86_64-installer.exe` file from the latest release at https://github.com/reflectometry/refl1d/releases
- If the browser flags the installer as unknown software, follow the prompts to keep it.
- Run the installer.
- Optional shortcuts may be added for:
  - Launching the Refl1D webview GUI from the Start Menu
  - Launching a Refl1D PowerShell session for installing additional libraries or using the command line
  - Launching the Refl1D webview GUI from the Desktop
- To upgrade, uninstall the old version from Windows “Add or remove programs,” then repeat the installation steps with the newer version.
- Multiple Refl1D versions can be run simultaneously without issue.

### macOS installation

Use the DMG bundle appropriate for the computer architecture:

- Download `...Darwin-arm64.dmg` for newer Apple Silicon / M-series Macs.
- Download `...Darwin-x86_64.dmg` for older Intel Macs.
- Open the `.dmg` file and drag the Refl1D app to the `/Applications` folder shortcut.
- Launch the Refl1D webview with `refl1d.app` in `/Applications/refl1d-<version>`.
- Launch a Refl1D shell with `refl1d_shell.app` to add additional Python packages, for example `pip install molgroups`.

### Python Package Index installation

Refl1D can also be installed from PyPI.

Requirements and commands:

```bash
pip install refl1d[webview]
```

- Install Python 3.9 or greater, such as from Python.org or Anaconda.
- Open a terminal window or Anaconda Prompt.
- Run the install command above.
- Running `refl1d` from the command line starts the command-line client.
- Running `refl1d --edit` starts an interactive fitting session.
- Running `pip install --upgrade refl1d` updates Refl1D to the latest version.

## Reductus

Reductus is a web application for reducing NCNR raw instrument data to reflectivity data.

Reductus is driven by the `reflred` Python libraries and supports common operations needed to convert raw X-ray and neutron reflectivity data into a reflectivity curve in physical units, `R` vs. `Q`. Supported operations include corrections such as background subtraction and scaling.

Key workflow notes:

- Data files are accessed directly by URL from the NCNR online data repository.
- Reduction templates, or recipes, can be modified with a graphical editor.
- Templates can be downloaded and reused or shared by email.
- Reduced data can be downloaded as columnar text files.
- No login or password is required.
- Reductus replaces the older Reflpak application.

## PeriodicTable / SLD calculator

The online SLD and activation calculator uses the same PeriodicTable package as Refl1D and SasView to compute scattering length density and neutron activation.

## Web reflectivity calculators

The page links to browser-based reflectivity calculators for quick data exploration.

Available calculators:

- Magnetic reflectivity calculator: https://ncnr.nist.gov/instruments/magik/calculators/magnetic-reflectivity-calculator.html
- Non-magnetic / unpolarized reflectivity calculator: https://ncnr.nist.gov/instruments/magik/calculators/reflectivity-calculator.html

The calculators allow user-generated SLD profiles to be exported to a heavily commented Python Refl1D model file, providing a starting point for modeling data in Refl1D.
